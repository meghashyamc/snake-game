A simple desktop snake game that's supposed to run on Linux and Mac OS (maybe eventually on Windows).

Some improvements needed:

* The snake's body currently functions as 'one' unit and does not get twisted when the snake turns

* When the game is over, the game over text's font and positioning could be better

* The colours of the snake and the background window's colour could be better

* If a direction key is consistently pressed to speed up the snake, there is an edge case where the food particle may not be eaten by the snake even when the snake passes over it

* The snake's body design is a bit too simplistic and can be improved
